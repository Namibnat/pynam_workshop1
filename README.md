# PYNAM WORKSHOP 1

The goal of this project was really to get the most
simple django project to work - just to get beginners
to a starting point with Django.

The project is build with Django 1.9.  I encouraged
participants to use Python 3.5 as I think it's very important
for new users to just get going in Python 3.
